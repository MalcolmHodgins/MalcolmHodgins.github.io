  <h2> Introduction </h2>
    <p>
      In the final installment of the Self-Balancing Inverted Pendulum series, we will be covering the controller design for the robot constructed through the previous posts in this series. We will also be demoing the operation of the robot, once the Arduino code has been loaded onto the robot.
