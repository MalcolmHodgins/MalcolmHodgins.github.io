    <ul>
      <li>Collaborated with a team to prioritize funding for Capital Projects, either ongoing, or proposed for start in 2020. Evaluated based on net present value, internal rate of return, and risk management.</li>
      <li>Performed post-implementation assessments on equipment replacement projects to evaluate the project initiation and execution process at Bruce Power. Compared expected outcomes, budgets, and timelines to project results.</li>
      <li>Coordinated planned work activities with multiple departments and made technical presentations to add work orders to reactor outage scope of work.</li>
      <li>Automated maintenance and reporting of important nuclear safety metrics using Excel VBA. Prepared and executed test cases to improve software reliability.</li>

    <ul>
      <li>Designed, implemented, and evaluated a particle image velocimetry (PIV) experiment seeking to demonstrate the effects of experimental setup uncertainties on measurements taken in high-gradient fluid velocity fields.</li>
      <li>Developed Python and Matlab code which could efficiently convert raw data files from the data acquisition system into a variety of plots relevant to the data analysis.</li>
      <li>Employed Autodesk Inventor to design flourescent laser positioning targets and a honeycomb flow straighter to minimize experimental uncertainty.</li>
