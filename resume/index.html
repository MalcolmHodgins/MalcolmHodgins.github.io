      <strong>Self-Balancing Inverted Pendulum<br>
      May 2020 - July 2020</strong>
    </p>
  </div>
  <div>
    <ul>
      <li>Designed and implemented a free-standing inverted pendulum robot which can remain upright indefinitely and reject finite amplitude disturbances.</li>
      <li>A gyroscope/accelerometer package was used to measure pendulum attitude and a quadrature encoder was used measure surface position and speed.</li>
      <li>An Arduino Mega 2560 executed instructions as a full-state feedback controller, instructing DC gearmotors to provide control action.
      <li>The full-state feedback controller was designed using a Matlab model of the open-loop system based on the physical parameters of the structure i.e. height, mass, moment of inertia.</li>
      <li>The pendulum housing was designed in Autodesk Inventor and 3D printed to compactly house all system components.</li>
